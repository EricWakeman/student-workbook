# How to write to console, which tab shows html css, other ways to debug.

The two main ways to print to the console are console.log and console.error. Logging information is good for testing functionality, while console error is good for helping you locate the source of problem in the code. The elements tab allows you to view and modify css and html without altering the saved data in the project. Using the elements window you can test line by line and see the changes in real time. Using break points is a usefull debugging tool. Breakpoints stops the loading of data and allows you to run teh code line by line from a specific point.
