# Scope, Hoisting, Let/Const/Var?

Scope is the area in which a variable declaration is available. Hoisting is a JS property that brings declarations to the top of their Scope areas before running the code. With the short comings in found in the Var declaration, using the Let declarationg would suit most all situation unless the variable needs to be absolute for some reason in which and the Const declaration would be more fitting.
