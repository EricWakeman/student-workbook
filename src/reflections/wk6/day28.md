# What are lifecycle hooks, how are they used, what are mounting hooks, how are they used?

Lifecycle hooks are call function that get invoked during certain points in the vue rendering process. Adding a lifecycle hook will allow you to run peices of code at specific points of code dependant on other pieces loading first or after. Mounting hooks are a type of lifecycle hooks that are activated around components being rendered to the DOM. They are used to run code when the route is changed.
