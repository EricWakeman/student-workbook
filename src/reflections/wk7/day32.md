# What is code documentation, what are ways to document code, what are the benefits, how important is it and why?

Code documentation is adding of details, descriptions, and/or instructions to pair with your code. Code documentiation can come in the form of a README, a tutorial, or inside the code itself. Code documentation makes the code more accessibly to other users/collaborators and to oneself should you forget what pieces of code do what.
