# What is Wire Framing, what kinds are there, are they worth it?

A wire frame is a rough visual plan for a web site/application. Using basic tools, whether on pen and paper or on a digital medium, an outline for visualizing a web page, before it is put into code, can be made. Wire frames can come in low to mid to high fidelity iterations. The higher fidelity frames have more detail and are a closure representation of a final product but are more time consuming to produce, and the opposite is true respectively for lower fidelity frames. Wireframing is an inexpensive and relatively fast method of preparing for development. It may take up time before jumping into writing the code for your project but I think it is worth the effort because it more than makes up for lost time with increased work efficiently when working with a guide as opposed to planning while coding.
