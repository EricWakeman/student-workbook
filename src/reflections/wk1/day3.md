# Design tips: favorite tips, name resources, how does good design influence users.

My favorite tips from this article are using offset shadows on containers and avoiding unnecessary borders. Offset shadows are really useful for giving a more organic feel to an otherwise cold, sterile box of text. Using other methods besides borders to separate elements of your page can, again, create a more organic feeling and can be easier for the eyes to navigate. On the website https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/homepage-design/ there is a collection of home pages that have effective designs. Having an effective design creates a more positive experience for the user. With a more enjoyable ease of experience through a web application, the user is more likely to have a positive opinion of the source product, service, or other.
