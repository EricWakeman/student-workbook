# Purpose of encapsulation, problems with undersocre method and closures, how to create private variables in ES6 and why?

Encapsulation is the process of breaking apart code into organized pieces of segregated data that have restricted methods of access. This both helps make reading and debugging easier in larger projects as well as prevents users from accessing data that they are not intended to access. Underscore prefixes and closures do not prevent users from accessing the data directly. Private variables are defined outside of the class in the controllers or elsewhere outside the main.js.
