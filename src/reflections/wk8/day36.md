# What function does a dev portfolio provide, what makes one effective, what would you include?

A dev portfolio provides a tangible resource for companies and clients to see your skills as a coder in practice. Having a portfolio that shows the range of projects and technologies you are proficient with, the level of quality you put into your projects, and showcasing your own personal brand can be an effective means of standing out from the competition. I would include the projects complete past inspire. I would alter any projects before adding them to more reflect on my current ability and knowledge.
